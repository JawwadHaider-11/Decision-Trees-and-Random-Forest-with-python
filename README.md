# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-with-python

In this repo i have applied decision tree Classifier and a random forest classifier on kyphosis data set both of the classifiers worked quite well.
about kyphosis dataset:
This dataset essentially represents a number of patients who had kyphosis and then they had an operation and that operation was a corrective spinal surgery and this dataframe basically represents whether or not the kyphosis condition was absent or present after the operation, Age represents the age of a person in months so this is the data on childrens, Number represents the number of vertabrae involved in the operation, And the Start was the number of the first or the top most vertibrae that was operated on.
